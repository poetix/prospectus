The untenable has become the unmaintainable...

For posterity, here's what I was saying about Musk's Twitter takeover as long ago as November 14th:

> It's...funny? I guess? to see a capitalist bullish enough to do to tech infrastructure what they've already done to every other kind of infrastructure. For a while the techies had the clout and mystique to hold off the barbarians, but looks like here they fucking come.
> "Nothing works but it's cheap" is phase 1. Phase 2 is "nothing works, and now it's ruinously expensive".
> Just for now it's funny to see Musk mocked and despised by his entire workforce for being a pig-ignorant wrecker, but he's the first I've seen to really go all in for an "oderint dum metuant" approach to the tech professional caste, and it's gonna suck if it catches on.
> The capitalist class has long resented but tolerated us because we're an obstacle to the arbitrary expression of their will but they need us to get things done. Musk is pioneering a disciplinary wave intended to push us back down into our place.
> They just have to hold their nerve while everything we've built for them crumbles into ruins, then get something that performs the core function of funnelling cash in their direction hacked together on the cheap by a deskilled and demoralised workforce.
> Reminded of the sequence in Succession where they acquire then nuke and asset strip that hapless new media company.

It seems like the engineers have won this round: anyone with any self-respect looked at the prospect of working themselves into an early grave for a tyrannical huckster and decided to hit the exit. Atlas shrugged, bitch.

I haven't come to any decisions about new venues for posting. Might do Mastodon; might not. If it's just blogging, I'll do it over at [The Last Instance](httos://thelastinstance.com). Some interaction might be nice though. I remain on [FB](https://www.facebook.com/reynardine) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/codepoetics/), and I'm reachable at (mailto://dominic.fox@gmail.com) (for years people posted email addresses in lightly obscured form -- "dominic DOT fox AT etc" -- online because spammers were known to scrape addresses off websites, but I'm assuming that these days they're all using the same ready-compiled lists anyway).

I liked Twitter a lot. People were their best and worst selves on there, and both could be hilarious. There'll be other things no doubt. The TikTok teens are going to hate it when my generation show up _en masse_, which will be good for whoever's plotting the successor site they'll all emigrate to. It's the circle of life.
